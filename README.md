# Pytello
This is ArUco Detector with python OpenCV and DJI Tello drone

Prerequisities:

OpenCV:
```cmd
pip install opencv-python
```

TelloPy:
```cmd
pip install tellopy
```
[The tello file is burrowed from hanyazou's tellopy library](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy "Check his library out")
This library makes up for its lack of feature with very low latancy in videostream.


Simpful:
```cmd
pip install simpful
```

[Simpful is found here](https://github.com/aresio/simpful)

I could use fuzzylite though it is not recommended as this one is far easier to use.
